| Class              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0: Winter cereal            | Winter seeded cereal, such as winter rye.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 1: Other winter crop        | Other winter seeded plants, such as winter turnip rape.                                                                                                                                                |
| 2: Cereal                   | Cereals such as oats or wheat, which are usually sown in spring.                                                  |
| 21: Spring or Winter cereal | There are some IACS codes which are controversial, such as 1310 "fodder barley" and they can be either winter or spring-sown cultivars.
| 3: Spring sown annual crops | Crops which are not cereal, are annual and are seeded in spring, such as broad beans and peas.                                                                                                         |
| 4: Vegetables               | In Finland, almost all vegetables are annual in industrial use, and those which are not (rhubarb) represent only a small fraction of the area. To simplify, all vegetables are thus treated similarly. |
| 5: Annual temporary grass   | Usually, a companion crop used as fodder or green manure. The class is uncertain because temporary grass can be transformed into permanent grassland in the register.                                  |
| 6: Permanent grassland      | Grassland and fodder which is likely to be permanent, such as 6123 "permanent grass for seed production".                                                                                              |
| 7: Caraway                  | Caraway produces yield in the second year, so it gets special treatment while making assumptions on winter cover. There might be a need to check the summer -1 situation as well.                      |
| 8: Fibrous hemp             | In Finland, fibrous hemp is often harvested next spring of the seeding year. That is why the winter cover is most probably "other vegetation cover" if the summer 0 class is fibrous hemp.            |
| 9: Permanent vegetation     | Finnish Food Authority's list of permanent vegetation, such as fruit trees or bushes.                                                                                                                  |
| 10: Renovation plants       | Plants, which are seeded to improve soil or tackle plant pests and diseases and are not harvested.                                                                                                     |
| 11: Other                   | Other vegetation, which cannot be classified into a certain class. For example, 9101 "20 yr special support area, a field".                                                                            |

Groups 12, 14 and 15 were later combined to suitable larger groups.
